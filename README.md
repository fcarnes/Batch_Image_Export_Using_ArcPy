1) The ExportJPGs_batch.py: uses ExportToJPEG module in arcpy. This script will export a single data frame with one raster layer and  its boundary layer in the .mxd.  

2) Data_Driven_Pages_Image_Export_Arcpy.py: This script will export Data Driven Pages to JPEG formats. Note: To export Data Driven Pages, two conditions must be met: Data Driven Pages must be enabled and the map document must be in layout view.
